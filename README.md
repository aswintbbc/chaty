## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

2. Set up a Firebase project and enable Firestore.

### Setting Up Firebase

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Click on **Add Project** and follow the steps to create a new project.
3. Once the project is created, navigate to the **Project Settings**.
4. Under the **General** tab, add your app:
   - For Android, download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app` directory.
   - For iOS, download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and place it in the `ios/Runner` directory.
5. Enable Firestore:
   - Go to the **Firestore Database** section in the Firebase Console.
   - Click on **Create Database**.
   - Choose a **Start in production mode** or **Start in test mode** based on your requirements.
   - Select a Cloud Firestore location and click **Enable**.

### Installation

1. Add Chaty to your `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     chaty: ^X.X.X
   ```
2. Run the following command to install the package:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Usage

To integrate Chaty into your Flutter app:

1. Import the necessary components:
   ```dart
   import 'package:chaty/ui/chat_screen.dart';
   import 'package:chaty/models/message.dart';
   ```
2. Use the `ChatScreen` widget:
   ```dart
   ChatScreen(
     senderId: 'user1',
     receiverId: 'user2',
     mediaUploaderFunction: (mediaPath) async {
       // function that upload the mediapath and return the URL
       return 'uploaded_media_url';
     },
   );
   ```

## Example

Here is a minimal example to get started:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:chaty/ui/chat_list_screen.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  /// Checks if the initialization has already been performed and avoids
  /// re-initializing if it has. This helps prevent redundant operations
  /// or potential errors caused by multiple initializations.
  await ChatService.instance.initializeFirebase();//remove if already initalised.
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ChatListScreen(
        currentUserId: 'user1',
        chatTileBuilder: ({required chatSummary}) {
          return ListTile(
            title: Text("Chat with ${chatSummary.otherUserId}"),
            subtitle: Text(chatSummary.lastMessage),
            trailing: Text(chatSummary.lastMessageTime.toLocal().toString()),
            onTap: () {
              // Navigate to ChatScreen
            },
          );
        },
        getnumberOfusers: (int numberOfUsers) {
          print("Number of users: $numberOfUsers");
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
